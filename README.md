# Global-Warming-in-Adelaide-Analysis-and-Visualization
This analysis and visualization of temperature data in Adelaide aims to shed light on key aspects of fluctuations in the temperature in the state and whether it is affected by global warming. 
This will be conducted by tracking a total of two datasets pertaining to minimum and maximum temperature within Adelaide. These datasets contain information regarding the daily minimum temperature from 16th February 1955 to 9th October 2023 and the daily maximum temperature from 16th February 1955 to 8th October 2023. 
For this analysis we will assume that the highest temperature is recorded during the day and the lowest temperature during the night to allow for easier comparison.

By examining temperature variations over the years, we have observed significant shifts in both hot and cold days. Notably, there has been a gradual increase in the occurrence of hot days, suggesting a warming trend over time, and conversely, a decrease in the frequency of cold days. 
These findings align with the overarching climate change paradigm associated with global warming, wherein temperatures are on the rise, and extreme temperature events are becoming more common.
In addition, it's worth noting that there has been greater uncertainty in day temperatures, with fluctuations becoming more prominent. This heightened variability in day temperatures underscores the dynamic nature of Adelaide's climate, as it adapts to the effects of global warming.
The observed temperature fluctuations underscore the dynamic nature of Adelaide's climate, as it adapts to the effects of global warming. These changes have significant implications for the region's environment, agriculture, and overall way of life. As such, it becomes increasingly crucial for policymakers, scientists, and the community at large to address and mitigate the consequences of these temperature shifts, and to implement strategies aimed at minimizing the impact of climate change on the city and its residents.
